        <h1 class="mb-3">Krystal Herrera
        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">PsychologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Krystal is a senior studying Psychology at the University of California Riverside. Upon completion of her Bachelors, she is hoping to attain a Masters in Social Work. Krystal is passionate about serving people in need and making a difference in their lives. The concentration she is most interested in pursuing is Mental Health and Wellness. Her goal is to help people reach their highest potential by changing the conversation about mental health. <br><br>

        Krystal has a special interest in depression, suicide, anxiety, family systems, grief and loss and relationship stress.
        Currently, she volunteers as a Crisis Counselor for the Crisis Text Line. Here she helps texters move from a hot moment to a cool calm through active listening, building rapport, and problem solving. Krystal works together with each texter individually to create coping mechanisms and build support based on each personâ€™s needs and circumstances. 
        She was also a part of Active Minds at UCR, which is a peer group organization with the focus on mental health and destigmatization. The focus of the group is to educate and empower students on campus through educational programs, awareness campaigns and social events.  Some of the events include Therapy Fluffies, Send Silence Packing and Stress Management workshops for the campus community. <br><br>

        One of the ways Krystal has connected with her local community is through her internship at Big Brothers Big Sisters of the Inland Empire. Big Brothers Big Sisters is a non-profit that works to connect volunteers in the community with children in need of a mentor that can help them reach their highest potential. Here she attends resource fairs and community events in order to engage, educate, and offer families mentoring services.
        Krystal has learned the inner workings of a non-profit and gained skills in transcribing and assessments to create comprehensive data reports of volunteer and family interviews. <br><br>
        
        Some of Krystalâ€™s earliest jobs, although not related to mental health, helped her gain valuable customer service experience. Krystalâ€™s first job was at Regal Cinemas where she worked for three years. Working at a movie theater allowed her to work and interact with people from many different backgrounds. 
        She learned how to problem solve by assisting patrons with special needs, settling seating disputes and training incoming employees. Working at Walgreens expanded her customer service experience by learning how to increase sales as the Beauty Sales Adviser. Krystal increased sales by planning and executing weekly activities to increase both customer and employee satisfaction. <br><br>
        
        While Krystal has just begun to dip her toes in to the mental health field, her background and experience show promise and passion to be an advocate for those that cannot help themselves. She plans to continue her education and bring social change to her community in the Inland Empire.
